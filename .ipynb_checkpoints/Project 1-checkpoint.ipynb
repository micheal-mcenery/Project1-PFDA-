    "The purpose of this project is to synthesise a data set which simulates an investigation of a real-world phenomenon. The phenomenon I have chosen to investigate for this project is Happiness, more speficifally, predictors of human happiness in adults. This will be done by simulating a dataset with 100 datapoints for 4 key variables; Human happiness (the dependent variable), and three predictor variables (Age, Income, Years in Education). Outlined below are further details on how these variables will be measured, their relationships with one another, and their distributions."

Research by Vera-Villarroel et al. (2012) has indicated higher socioeconomic to be associoated with higher levels of happiness, with higher age predicting lower levels of happiness.  \n",

    "As touched on previously, much research has shown links between levels of income and happiness. Research by Clark, Frijters and Shields (2006) who, when examining the European Social Survey, found that across Europe income was positively correlated with both happiness and life satisfaction, however had a negative effect on personal well being. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, I have outlined the findings of Toshkov (2022), more specifically, the findings which indicated that for life-long high income individuals, levels of happiness levels were consistent over time. These findings are consistent with the \"Easterlin Paradox\", which states that while cross sectionally happiness and income can be considered related, over time growth rates of happiness are not signifiacntly related to increased income in developed nations (Easterlin and O'Connor, 2020). When discussing the Easterlin Paradox, researchers Caporale, Georgellis, Tsitsianis and Yin (2009) argue that while initial higher income brings both consumption and status benefits to an individual, over time these benefits are a \"zero sum gain\" and that these benefits do not increase at the same rate as increased income, resulting in a flattening of happiness rates across high income individuals."

People how have achieved higher education by their thirties are on average happier then their less educated counterparts (Nikolaev and Rusakov, 2016). Research has also indicated that people who achieve higher education have \"more extensive social networks as well as greater involvement with the wider world\", both traits which are positively related to happiness (Chen, 2012)."
